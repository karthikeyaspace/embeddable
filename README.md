- do if else for all the api calls
- perform validation in frontend and backend
- after finishing - optimize the code - reduce db calls etc
- try storing prev messages, ai config, description in localstorage
- use context sent req 3 times when logged in - fix it
- localstorage data for authentication  - token, expiresAt, email, emailverified
